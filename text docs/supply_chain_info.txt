Reinventing supply chains with generative AI

Generative AI is one of the biggest breakthroughs in AI’s history. Signifying a new era of enterprise intelligence, it holds out huge promise for supply chains in every industry. 

That’s because, combined with analytics capabilities, it puts new kinds of hyper-intelligence into the hands of supply chain professionals, dramatically amplifying what they can achieve. 

As humans working with generative AI “colleagues” become the norm, every role in every supply chain has the potential to be transformed. 

From advising on vendor selection to introducing new speed and creativity to product design, 

and from accelerating onboarding of supply chain partners to transforming customer service interactions and introducing new sustainability to E2E operations, 

one thing is clear: generative AI ‘s arrival means supply chains will never be the same again.  

To secure future competitive advantage, now is the time for supply chain leaders to understand and begin to adopt this breakthrough technology.

The basic components of supply chain management

Supply chains vary by company and industry. But at their core, they comprise several interdependent disciplines and, at a high level, commonly contain seven basic components:

Engineering: Creating a new product that customers will want.

Planning: Anticipating and optimizing events through visibility within every step of the supply chain.

Sourcing and Procurement: Identifying and buying the components that make up a product, with the aim of ensuring quality and reliability at the lowest cost.

Inbound Logistics: Handling the transportation of goods into a business.

Manufacturing: Making enough products to satisfy demand and maintain target inventory levels.

Fulfillment and Delivery: Getting a product to the customer as quickly and economically as possible.

Service Management: Maintaining or fixing a product to ensure customer satisfaction.

From Engineering to Service Management, each area’s output is the input to the next—each link relies on the others to form a strong supply chain. 

For example, Sales and Operations Planning can provide real-time sales results to inform product innovation that drives repeat business.

 In addition, Procurement must source and buy the right parts and get them to the right plant in time to meet production schedules.

 And products must be made and shipped on time to ensure that customers get what they want, when they were promised.

Intelligent supply networks are similar, but they have one key difference: 

They leverage digital tools and technologies to optimize the supply chain and provide visibility across the ecosystem to deliver deeper insights and greater value, more quickly. 

This shift has a knock-on impact on the seven core components of supply chain management, and the skills that each requires.

Why is supply chain management important?

Effective supply chain management systems minimize cost, waste and time in the production cycle. 

The industry standard has become a just-in-time supply chain where retail sales automatically signal replenishment orders to manufacturers. 

Retail shelves can then be restocked almost as quickly as product is sold. 

One way to further improve on this process is to analyze the data from supply chain partners to see where further improvements can be made.

By analyzing partner data, the CIO.com post identifies three scenarios where effective supply chain management increases value to the supply chain cycle:

Identifying potential problems. When a customer orders more product than the manufacturer can deliver, the buyer can complain of poor service.

 Through data analysis, manufacturers may be able to anticipate the shortage before the buyer is disappointed.

Optimizing price dynamically. Seasonal products have a limited shelf life.

 At the end of the season, these products are typically scrapped or sold at deep discounts. Airlines, 

hotels and others with perishable “products” typically adjust prices dynamically to meet demand. 

By using analytic software, similar forecasting techniques can improve margins, even for hard goods.

Improving the allocation of “available to promise” inventory.

 Analytical software tools help to dynamically allocate resources and schedule work based on the sales forecast, actual orders and promised delivery of raw materials. 

Manufacturers can confirm a product delivery date when the order is placed — significantly reducing incorrectly-filled orders.

Evolution of supply chain management

While yesterday’s supply chains were focused on the availability, movement and cost of physical assets, today’s supply chains are about the management of data,

 services and products bundled into solutions. Modern supply chain management systems are about much more than just where and when.

 Supply chain management affects product and service quality, delivery, costs, customer experience and ultimately, profitability.

As recently as 2017, a typical supply chain accessed 50 times more data than just five years earlier. However, less than a quarter of this data is being analyzed. 

 That means the value of critical, time-sensitive data — such as information about weather, sudden labor shortages, political unrest and microbursts in demand — can be lost.

Modern supply chains take advantage of massive amounts of data generated by the chain process and are curated by analytical experts and data scientists.

 Future supply chain leaders and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems they manage will likely focus on optimizing the usefulness of this data — analyzing it in real time with minimal latency.
