ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows you to have

human-like conversations and much more with the chatbot. 

The language model can answer questions and assist you with tasks, such as composing emails,

essays, and code.

It's currently open to use by the public for free because ChatGPT is in its research and 

feedback-collection phase. A paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus launched at the 

beginning of February.

Who made ChatGPT?

ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an AI and research company. The company launched ChatGPT on 

November 30, 2022. 

OpenAI is also responsible for creating DALL-E 2, a popular AI art generator, and Whisper, an 

automatic speech recognition system. 

How big a deal is ChatGPT?

It's a big deal -- think internet-level disruption. 

"ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI," said Elon Musk, who was one 

of the founders of OpenAI before leaving. Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief, said on Twitter that 

ChatGPT had more than one million users in the first five days after it launched. 

According to analysis by Swiss bank UBS, ChatGPT is the fastest-growing app of all time. The 

analysis estimates that ChatGPT had 100 million active users in January, only two months after 

its launch. For comparison, it took nine months for TikTok to reach 100 million users.

How can you access ChatGPT?

You can access ChatGPT simply by visiting chat.openai.com and creating an OpenAI account. 

You can also still use the old URL for the chatbot, which is chat.openai.com/chat. OpenAI 

simplified the original URL for user convenience. 

Once you sign in, you can start chatting away with ChatGPT. Get your conversation started by 

asking a question. Because ChatGPT is still in its research stage, it is free to use and you can 

ask as many questions as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions, check out ZDNET's guide on how to start using ChatGPT. 

As of May 18, you can also access ChatGPT via an app on your iPhone. 

How much does ChatGPT cost?

ChatGPT is free to use, regardless of what you use it for, including writing, coding, and much 

more. 

There is a subscription option that users can take advantage of that costs $20/month. The paid 

subscription model guarantees users extra perks, such as general access even at capacity, 

faster response times, and access to the internet through plugins. 

However, the free version is still a solid option as it has mostly the same technical 

abilities, with the exception of access to the latest version of the large language model 

(LLM), known as GPT-4, and the internet, which the subscription model guarantees. 

I tried using ChatGPT and it says it's at capacity. What does that mean?

ChatGPT is still free to use. Because of the stir its advanced capabilities have created, many 

people are flocking to use it. The website operates using a server, and when too many people 

hop onto the server, it overloads and can't process your request. 

This popularity doesn't mean you won't ever be able to access it. It just means you should try 

visiting the site at a later time when fewer people are trying to access the server. You can 

also keep the tab open and just refresh it periodically. 

If you want to skip the wait and have reliable access, there is an option for you. OpenAI's 

ChatGPT pro plan, known as ChatGPT Plus, allows users to have general access even during peak 

times, experience faster response times, and have priority access to new features and 

improvements, including OpenAI's most advanced LLM, GPT-4. The premium services cost $20 per 

month. 

You can also try using Bing's AI chatbot, Bing Chat. This chatbot is free to use, runs on 

GPT-4, does not have wait times, and has access to the internet. 

How are people using ChatGPT?

The model has many functions in addition to answering simple questions. ChatGPT can compose 

essays, describe art in great detail, create AI art prompts, have philosophical conversations, 

and even code for you. 

My personal favorite use is asking the chatbot for help creating basic lists for chores such as 

packing and grocery shopping, and to-do lists to make my daily life more productive. The 

possibilities are endless. 

ZDNET has published many ChatGPT how-to guides. Here are some of the most popular. 

How to use ChatGPT to: 

Write an essay

Create an app

Write code

Build your resume

Write Excel formulas

Summarize content

Write a cover letter

Start an Etsy business

How does ChatGPT work?

ChatGPT runs on a language model architecture created by OpenAI called the Generative Pre-

trained Transformer (GPT). The specific GPT used by ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the 

GPT-3.5 series, according to OpenAI. 

However, with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access ChatGPT with GPT-4, Open AI's most 

advanced model. 

Generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, 

including websites, books, news articles, and more. 

The language model was fine-tuned using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. 

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially 

unique. Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they 

played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI. 

What are ChatGPT's limitations?

Despite looking very impressive, ChatGPT still has limitations. Such limitations include the 

inability to answer questions that are worded in a specific way, as it requires rewording to 

understand the input question. A bigger limitation is a lack of quality in the responses it 

delivers -- which can sometimes be plausible-sounding but make no practical sense or can be 

excessively verbose. 

Also: 6 harmful ways ChatGPT can be used by bad actors

Instead of asking for clarification on ambiguous questions, the model just guesses what your 

question means, which can lead to unintended responses to questions. This limitation has 

already led developer question-and-answer site StackOverflow to at least temporarily ban 

ChatGPT-generated responses to questions.

"The primary problem is that while the answers that ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being 

incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to 

produce," say Stack Overflow moderators in a post. Critics argue that these tools are just very 

good at putting words into an order that makes sense from a statistical point of view, but they 

cannot understand the meaning or know whether the statements it makes are correct.

Also: AI has the potential to automate 40% of the average work day

Another major limitation is that ChatGPT's data is limited up to 2021. The chatbot does not 

have an awareness of events or news that have occurred since then. Lastly, ChatGPT does not 

provide sources for its responses. 

These two problems, however, were addressed through ChatGPT's integration into Bing as its 

default search engine. A Bing plugin gives ChatGPT the ability to index the internet and 

provide citations. The Bing plugin is limited to ChatGPT Plus subscribers at the moment, but 

will be free for everyone to use in the future.  

Can I chat with ChatGPT?

Although some people are using ChatGPT for some elaborate functions, such as writing code or 

even malware, you can use ChatGPT for more mundane activities, such as having a friendly 

conversation. 

Also: Do you like asking ChatGPT questions? You could get paid (a lot) for it

Some conversation starters could be as simple as, "I am hungry, what food should I get?" or as 

elaborate as, "What do you think happens in the afterlife?" Either way, ChatGPT is sure to have 

an answer for you. 

Can I chat with GPT-3?

The free version of ChatGPT runs on a model fine-tuned from the 3.5 series, an improved model 

from the original GPT-3. So if you want to chat with a model in the GPT-3 series, all you have 

to do is chat with ChatGPT's free version.

Also: How to use Bing Chat (and how it's different from ChatGPT)

If you want to use the more advanced LLM in the GPT series, GPT-4, you can become a ChatGPT 

Plus subscriber or use Bing Chat for free. 

Why are some people worried about ChatGPT?

People are expressing concerns about AI chatbots replacing or atrophying human intelligence. 

For example, the chatbot can write an article on any topic efficiently (though not necessarily 

accurately) within seconds, potentially eliminating the need for a human writer. 

Also: Even Google is warning its employees about AI chatbot use

The chatbot can also write an entire full essay within seconds, making it easier for students 

to cheat or avoid learning how to write properly. This has led to some school districts 

blocking access to it. 

Another concern with the AI chatbot is the possible spread of misinformation. Since the bot is 

not connected to the internet, it could make mistakes in what information it shares. 

Also: AI is more likely to cause world doom than climate change, according to an AI expert

The bot itself says: "My responses are not intended to be taken as fact, and I always encourage 

people to verify any information they receive from me or any other source." OpenAI also notes 

that ChatGPT sometimes writes "plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers."  

Is there a tool that can detect ChatGPT text?

With concerns about students using ChatGPT to cheat, the need for a ChatGPT text detector is 

becoming more evident. 

OpenAI, the AI research company behind ChatGPT, released an imperfect, free tool to target this 

problem. OpenAI's "classifier" tool can only correctly identify 26% of AI-written text with a 

"likely AI-written" designation. Furthermore, it provides false positives 9% of the time, 

incorrectly identifying human-written work as AI-produced work. 

Also: ChatGPT dropped a free app for iPhones. Does it live up to the hype?

Other AI detectors also exist on the market, including GPT-2 Output Detector, Writer AI Content 

Detector, and Content at Scale AI Content Detection. ZDNET put these tools to the test and the 

results were underwhelming. All three of the tools were found to be unreliable sources for 

spotting AI, repeatedly giving false negatives. Here are ZDNET's full test results. 

Although tools aren't sufficient to detect ChatGPT-generated writing, a study shows that humans 

might be able to detect AI-written text by looking for politeness. The study's results indicate 

that ChatGPT's writing style is extremely polite. And unlike humans, it cannot produce 

responses that include metaphors, irony, or sarcasm.

Is ChatGPT a good or bad thing?

ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot that has the potential to both make people's lives easier and 

assist with everyday tedious tasks, such as writing emails or navigating the web for answers. 

However, certain technical details have to be figured out before it's widely used to prevent 

negative outcomes, such as the spread of misinformation. In general, AI and machine learning 

(ML) models rely on lots of training and fine-tuning to reach a level of ideal performance.

So, is AI taking over the world? Not yet, perhaps, but OpenAI's Altman certainly thinks that 

human-style intelligence in AI is now not that far off. Responding to Musk's comment about 

dangerously strong AI, Altman tweeted: "I agree on being close to dangerously strong AI in the 

sense of an AI that poses e.g. a huge cybersecurity risk. and i think we could get to real AGI 

in the next decade, so we have to take the risk of that extremely seriously too."

Also: Most Americans think AI threatens humanity, according to a poll

He also noted: "interesting watching people start to debate whether powerful AI systems should 

behave in the way users want or their creators intend. the question of whose values we align 

these systems to will be one of the most important debates society ever has."

What is GPT-4?

GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI's language model system, and it is much more advanced 

than its predecessor GPT-3.5, which ChatGPT runs on. 

GPT-4 is a multimodal model that accepts both text and images as input, and it outputs text. 

This multimodal nature can be useful for uploading worksheets, graphs, and charts to be 

analyzed. 

Also: What is GPT-4? Here's everything you need to know

Currently, GPT-4's text-input capabilities are the only ones available to the public. Users can 

access these functions by subscribing to ChatGPT Plus for $20 per month or by using Bing Chat.

The day that GPT-4 was unveiled by OpenAI, Microsoft shared that its chatbot, Bing Chat, had 

been running on GPT-4 since its launch. This chatbot is free to use and open to everyone. 

Also: Now you can access Bing Chat without a Microsoft account

GPT-4 has advanced intellectual capabilities that allow it to outperform GPT-3.5 in a series of 

simulated benchmark exams. It has also reduced the number of hallucinations produced by the 

chatbot.
